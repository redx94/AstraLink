The system generates 1 million quantum-secure keys per second with an entropy level > 0.99 and error rate < 0.001%.

### 2. Network Performance

#### Q: What is the network's transaction throughput?
- Standard transactions: 10,000+ TPS
- Smart contract operations: 5,000+ TPS
- Quantum operations: 1M keys/second

#### Q: How is network latency managed?
AI-driven optimization maintains sub-10ms latency through:
- Dynamic routing
- Load balancing
- Quantum-assisted decision making
- Predictive scaling

### 3. eSIM Integration

#### Q: How do I provision a new eSIM?
```http
POST /api/v1/esim
Content-Type: application/json
{
    "user_id": "your_id",
    "plan_type": "standard",
    "bandwidth": 1000
}
```

#### Q: What's the activation time for new eSIMs?
Typical activation times:
- Standard provision: < 1 second
- Custom configurations: < 5 seconds
- Emergency provision: < 500ms

## Development Questions

#### Q: How are quantum signatures verified in contracts?
```solidity
function verifyQuantumSignature(bytes memory signature) public view returns (bool) {
    return quantum.verify(signature, msg.sender);
}
```

### 2. API Integration

#### Q: What authentication method should I use?
Use API keys in the Authorization header:
```
Authorization: Bearer <api_key>
```
