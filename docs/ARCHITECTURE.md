# AstraLink Architecture

## System Components

1. **Blockchain Layer**
   - Smart Contracts (Solidity)
   - Cross-chain Bridge
   - NFT Management

2. **AI Layer**
   - Multiversal Forecasting
   - Quantum Integration
   - Threat Detection

3. **Network Layer**
   - eSIM Management
   - Resource Allocation
   - Bandwidth Distribution

## Integration Points

Each component communicates through standardized APIs and event systems:

- Smart contracts emit events for system state changes
- AI modules provide predictions through REST APIs
- Network components use gRPC for real-time communication
