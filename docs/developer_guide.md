- **quantum_network**: Quantum network-related scripts and documentation.
- **sdk**: SDK-related files.
- **solidity**: Solidity-related files.
- **test**: Test-related files.
- **tools**: Various tools and utilities.

## Coding Standards

### General Guidelines

- **Consistency**: Follow the existing coding style and conventions.
- **Documentation**: Ensure all functions and classes have docstrings.
- **Testing**: Write unit tests for all new functionality.
- **Security**: Follow security best practices, especially in cryptographic operations.

### Solidity

- **Version**: Use Solidity version ^0.8.0.
- **Imports**: Use relative imports for internal dependencies.
- **Naming**: Use camelCase for functions and variables, and PascalCase for contracts and structs.
- **Comments**: Use NatSpec format for comments.

### Python

- **Style Guide**: Follow PEP 8.
- **Imports**: Use absolute imports.
- **Logging**: Use the `logging` module for logging.
- **Type Hints**: Use type hints for function arguments and return types.

## Security Best Practices

### Cryptographic Operations

- **Libraries**: Use well-vetted cryptographic libraries (e.g., PyCryptodome, Python cryptography package).
- **Key Management**: Use hardware security modules (HSMs) or secure enclaves for key storage.
- **Randomness**: Use high-entropy sources for random number generation.

### Input Validation

- **Strict Checks**: Implement strict type and range checks on all user and network inputs.
- **Exception Handling**: Use structured exception handling to avoid leaking sensitive details.

## Testing and CI/CD

### Unit Tests

- **Coverage**: Ensure all new functionality has corresponding unit tests.
- **Mocking**: Use mocking libraries to isolate dependencies.

### Integration Tests

- **End-to-End**: Write end-to-end tests to ensure components work together.
- **Environment**: Use isolated environments for testing.

### CI/CD Pipeline

- **Automation**: Automate testing and deployment using CI/CD tools.
- **Monitoring**: Monitor test results and deployment status.
