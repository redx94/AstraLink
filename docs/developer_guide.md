# Developer Guide

## Introduction
Welcome to the AstraLink Developer Guide. This guide provides instructions and templates to help you develop applications using AstraLink. It covers recent changes, new commits, and detailed instructions for developers.

## Recent Changes and New Commits

### Smart Contracts & Security Patches
- **Enhanced Smart Contracts**: Recent commits in the `contracts` folder include improvements in smart contract logic, with additional security hardening against common vulnerabilities (e.g., reentrancy and overflow) and enhanced input validation.
- **Security Hardening**: The updated smart contracts now include enhanced checks for edge cases and more rigorous input validation. It is recommended to continue using formal verification tools (e.g., MythX, Slither) to test against vulnerabilities in these critical modules.

### AI Module Enhancements
- **AI Algorithms**: The new commits in the `ai` directory have refined predictive models for network optimization. Review the integration of these models with blockchain transactions to ensure that data integrity is maintained.
- **Secure Data Handling**: Enhanced encryption and key management routines appear to be in place. Consider an additional audit focused on the AI pipeline to verify that end-to-end encryption standards are consistently applied, especially where data passes between decentralized nodes.

### Infrastructure & Deployment Scripts
- **Containerization & Deployment**: The revised `Dockerfile` and deployment scripts now better align with industry best practices. Ensure that non-root execution and minimized container footprints are verified through automated container scanning tools.
- **CI/CD Enhancements**: The updated workflows in the `.github/workflows` directory now include additional steps for static code analysis and security scanning. Continue integrating these tools and consider periodic reviews to adapt to emerging threats.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (v6 or later)
- Hardhat (for smart contract deployment)

### Setting Up the Development Environment
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AstraLink/AstraLink.git
   cd AstraLink
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary environment variables.

### Smart Contract Development
- **Smart Contracts Directory**: All smart contracts are located in the `contracts` directory.
- **Deployment Scripts**: Deployment scripts for smart contracts are located in the `deploy` directory.

### AI Module Development
- **AI Module Directory**: All AI-related code is located in the `ai` directory.
- **Predictive Models**: The `multiversal_forecaster.py` file contains the predictive models for network optimization.

### Deployment
- **Deployment Scripts**: Deployment scripts are located in the `deploy` directory.
- **Hardhat**: Use Hardhat for deploying smart contracts. Example deployment script:
  ```javascript
  const { ethers } = require("hardhat");

  async function main() {
    try {
      const [deployer] = await ethers.getSigners();
      console.log("Deploying contracts with the account:", deployer.address);

      const EnhancedDynamicESIMNFT = await ethers.getContractFactory("EnhancedDynamicESIMNFT");
      const contract = await EnhancedDynamicESIMNFT.deploy();
      await contract.deployed();

      console.log("EnhancedDynamicESIMNFT deployed to:", contract.address);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error deploying contract:", error);
    }
  }

  main()
    .then(() => process.exit(0))
    .catch((error) => {
      console.error(error);
      process.exit(1);
    });
  ```
