# Decentralized Mesh Network Configuration

This document provides instructions for setting up and managing a decentralized mesh network using AstraLink. Configured to enable flexible and resilient local network data transfer.

## Features

- Supports the use of lightweight, node-based decentralized mesh networks (your own routers).
- Uses looser or smaller enterprises such as loRaWAN for low-power communication.
- Can be integrated with satellite systems for geographically dispersed networks.

## Configuration steps for Mesh Networks

1. Choose a compatible node-manager like "Libremesh" or "Althea."
2. Install the required software for your system.
3. Configure the mesh nodes for automatic self-routing using lora (low-power and encrypted networks).
4. Set up channels for low-delay instances and data synchronization.
