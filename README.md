## Smart Contracts & API
AstraLink’s decentralized management begins with robust smart contracts. Below is an enhanced example for node registration that includes event logging and safety checks:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.1;

contract TelecomNodeRegistry {
    /// @notice Emitted when a new node is registered
    event NodeRegistered(address indexed nodeAddress, uint256 timestamp);

    /// @notice Mapping to track registered nodes
    mapping(address => bool) public registeredNodes;

    /// @notice Registers a new telecom node if not already registered
    /// @param node The address of the telecom node to be registered
    function registerNode(address node) public {
        require(!registeredNodes[node], "Node already registered.");
        registeredNodes[node] = true;
        emit NodeRegistered(node, block.timestamp);
    }
}
```
*This contract forms the backbone for node authentication, enabling secure and transparent participation in the network.*

## Tokenomics & Financial Model
AstraLink's native token, **ASTRA**, is central to the ecosystem’s economy:

- **Token Utility:**  
  - **Payments & Settlements:** ASTRA is used for telecom service fees and inter-node settlements.
  - **Staking & Rewards:** Nodes stake ASTRA to secure network operations and receive rewards based on uptime, performance, and data relay contributions.
  - **Incentivized Participation:** Dynamic subscription models adjust rates based on AI-driven traffic predictions and real-time network analytics.

- **Economic Sustainability:**  
  - A self-regulating economy designed to balance supply and demand, ensuring long-term network resilience and growth.
  - Integrated governance mechanisms enable community-driven evolution of financial models and network policies.
